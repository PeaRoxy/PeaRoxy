	# It is always good idea to use a separated IP for PeaRoxy but in case you don't want to buy a separated IP, you can even use main IP. But if you want to
	# use port 80 too when using main IP and want to run web server at same time, you can change web server's port and then map it back on port 80 using 
	# HTTP Forwarding functionality of PeaRoxy.
	# HTTPForwardingPort: Current HTTP port
	# HTTPForwardingIP: Current HTTP IP address or Domain
	# PeaRoxyDomain: Domain string that users must use when want to connect to PeaRoxy server. Remember that using your real domain will disable http access
	# to it. You don't need to buy any domain or something. It is only an identification string but using a subdomain of your main domain will make it simple
	# reading. Also don't forget to give this string to your clients. They can't connect to your server without it.
